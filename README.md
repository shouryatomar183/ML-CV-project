# ML-CV-project
it's a Credit Card Lead Prediction using data provided by the hackathon organizers. it was a classification problem
I have applied all the major steps from preprocessing to EDA, then checked whether there is any class imbalance, created new features according to my understanding of the data and banking sector, applied functions to select the best features for data training, applied K-fold cross-validation , then applied simple prediction models like logistic regression, random forest, and K-NN, and after that tried boosting models like CatboostClassifier, XGBClassifier, and LGBMClassifier and then finally used Weighted average approach as I have found that CatBoostClassifier works best so using optimation found the weights for CatBoostClassifier, XGBClassifier and LGBMClassifier.

If I have used hyperparameter tuning I would have got even better results. Also, if i have used 10 fold crossvalidation instead of 5 fold cross validation my results would have been better
